# Project 2 Planning

Fork & Clone this repo.

## Part 1

Review the [Project 2 requirements](https://tmdarneille.gitbook.io/sei-ga-sea/11-projects/project-2#project-feedback-evaluation) and check out some [examples](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://tmdarneille.gitbook.io/sei-ga-sea/11-projects/past-projects/project2&sa=D&source=calendar&ust=1597596784944000&usg=AOvVaw1ihTzKFunxKsL2f6sIYdlC).

In this space below, list **THREE** ideas for your Project 2. For each idea, include [user stories](https://revelry.co/user-stories-that-dont-suck/) for each idea and a link to the API(s) you want to use for it.

--------------------------------------------------------
1. - As a user I would like to create a grocery list. I would like to use recipe api (https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-recipe-api) to add recipes and then return the grocery items from the recipes I've added.
2. - As a user I want to generate my own charcuterie board. I want to choose a cheese, and find pairings for other items based on that cheese. I want to use a scrape from my local wine store and pair tasting details with cheese options. (https://www.theaustinwinemerchant.com/bordeaux.html). I thought an api for cheese notes would exist, but it doesn't somehow. One exists for French cheeses without tasting notes though. 
3. - A website I actually need is a better noncheesy wedding website to help new functionality in covid. I want a user to log in with a password, be able to "sign" the guestbook with greetings. Able to view our wedding registry(scraped from our zola registry). I'd also like to add a google maps api for navigating to the chapel. Integrate photos and video from our album.
